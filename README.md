# PTU FancySheet Scraper

This project aims to scrape the Pokemon Tabletop United Fancy Sheet (A Google spreadsheet) in order to obtain the P.T.U. data in a JSON file.

For now, the spreadsheet used for parsing and testing is the [Fancy PTU 1.0.5 - Version Hisui](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/12RWq2ATMmbqNTngkTlwhwozcyE5Mk_JCA-tfwczx2u0/edit#gid=0), which has both the Erratas and some homebrew content in it (Mainly what's found in the [Miss DataNinja's Homebrew Compilation](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Y686fpUCixqBgic_NW_Wrk7X38vI9sqEiSMwFKRKWW0/edit)).
